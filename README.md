# ThreadScout

AI-assisted Reddit outreach copilot for turning a website into contextual, ready-to-post Reddit replies.

## What This Project Is

This app helps you promote a website in a non-spammy, contextual way:

1. Crawl a target website.
2. Use an LLM to summarize what the website offers and generate search terms.
3. Search Reddit for relevant threads.
4. Use an LLM to draft tailored replies for matching threads.
5. Show reply drafts, reasoning, and direct links to the original Reddit posts.

It is not a fully automated posting bot. It is a human-in-the-loop outreach assistant.

## Naming Recommendation

Your old name, "Automated Website Campaign," sounds broad and marketing-heavy. This product is more specific: it scouts Reddit opportunities and drafts replies.
